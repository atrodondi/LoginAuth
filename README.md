# Login Authentication w/ MongoDB and bcrypt

# Why

Needed to learn how to make functional user registration and login authentication for making apps in the future. So made a quick little guide for classmates.

NEED TO GET LOGIN ROUTES WORKING - done
NEED TO CONFIRM IF USER AUTHENTICATION IS WORKING, NOT SURE - done
MAKE SIMPLE FRONT END TO QUICKLY TEST IT FOR REACT COMPATIBILITY?
